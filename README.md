Library: p5.js

JavaScript - language
	"interpreted" - a program reads the code, and does it
	
Calling a function

	functionName ( any parameter separated by commas )
	
	createCanvas(200, 100)
	background(210)
	
	madeUpFunction();
	
the parenthesis are what make it a function CALL

; semicolon ends an expression
	technically, in javascript, they SEPARATE expressions
	
Coordinate system:
	0,0 is in the upper-right corner
	x moves left
	y moves down
	x,y

functions
	collections of code that can be called (run)
	a function must be DEFINED
	to call a function, name()
	pass parameters to the function in the parens goFunction(2, true)
	
IF if/else "conditional"

	if (condition) {
		body if true
	}
	
	if (condition) {
		body if true
	} else {
		body if false
	}
	
	a condition statement is an expression that resolves to true or false

VARIABLE

	name, contain (refer to) a value, declared before they can be used
	
	let x = 5;
	var y = 5;
	
	"let" declares a new variable
		"var" also declares a new varible
		"const" declares a new variable, but doesn't let you change the value
		
	= is the assignment operator
	
	if (x === 7){
		...;
	}
	
	Comparator Operators
		compare values
		return true or false - perfect for an if!
		
		> greater than
		< less than
		>= greater than or equal to
		<= less than or equal to
		=== is equal to
		== is equal to (but less good)
		!= not equal to

Expression
	a piece of code
	let x = 5;
	expressions can be built out of other expressions
	
	I [want to] [go to] [somewhere]
	
	if (something that must resolve to true or false)
	
	can resolve to a value
